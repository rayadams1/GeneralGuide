1). brew install node -> installs node on mac os using brew
2). node -v -> check the version of node on your machine
3). npm -v -> check the version of npm on your machine
4). npm install -g create-react-app -> This package allows you to bootstrap React applications with zero-configuration (-g makes it available globally)
5). create-react-app --version -> check the version of create-react-app
6). create-react-app demo-app -> This command installs a 
				 a). react	
				 b). lightweight development server
				 c). webpack -> for bundling our files 
				 d). babel -> modern javascript compiler
				 e). etc
7). npm start => Starts the development server
8). npm run build => Bundles the app into static files for production
9). npm test => Starts the test runner
10). npm run eject => Removes the tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. Once done we cannot go back 
11). npm start => launches the development server on port 3000 and open up the default browser
12). <div id="root"></div> in index.html is where the react application will appear.
13). ECMA Script is the standardized name for JavaScript.


React was developed by facebook and is one the most powerful javascript library along with Angular and View

Components:
1). They are piece of UI -> they should be independent , isolated and reusable
2). Every react app has atleast 1 component called the root component which contains other child components
3). Component is implemented as follows :
	class Tweet {
		state = {};
		render () {
			}
		    }
4). State is the data we want to display when the component is rendered
5). render method describes what the UI should look like
6). Ouput of render method -> plain JS Object that represents a DOM element in memory
7). React Element contains virtual DOM , Browser contains real DOM
8). react reacts to state changes and updates the part of the virtual and real dom that has been changed
9). React => Library(makes sure the view is in sync with the state & we have the flexibility to choose which external libraries we want to use) & Angular => Framework
10). Inside the render method is JSX Javascript XML.
11). index.js is the entry point for react application
12). registerServiceWorker.js provides assets from a local cache in a production environment
13). Virtual DOM is a lightweight in memory representation of the UI 

Extensions in Visual Studio Code:
1). Prettier Code Formatter  
2). Simple React Snippets

DependencyResolution:
If any dependency demands installing peer dependencies clone the dependency itself and run 'npm install dependency-name'

Shortcuts:
Command + D for multi cursor editing on VSCode
